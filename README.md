# Stanford Radar Group (SRG) SAR Processor

This repository hosts the Stanford Radar Group (SRG) SAR Processor, which includes utilities for performing the deformation time series analysis of volcanic regions from space-geodetic InSAR and GNSS observations. The SRG processor is being used within the NASA-funded Live Analysis of Volcano Activity with SAR (LAVAS) project, which aims to provide crustal deformation data for every active volcano in the world.
