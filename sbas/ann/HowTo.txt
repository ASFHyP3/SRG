Please follow these steps:

1.sbas_step1.m
 (1) Change line 6 "image size" of the unwrapped inteferograms
 (2) Change line 7 n is the number of slc images
 (3) Change line 11,28,37 to the path of the unwrapped images
 (4) Change line 22 to mask out the decorrelated pixels.
     Set the threshold to 0 to use all pixels
     In practice, I found it is good to set it to a small number (~0.1)

2.sbas_step2.m

 (1) Change line 5 to take additional looks
     Usually set it to 1 for best results.
     You need this option when your inversion is too slow and addtional looks might let you preview your results.
 (2) Change Line 32 to the wavelength of the satellite

***  I include a sample of "Tm.out","deltime.out" and "Bperp.out" with this package, see the sample folder for instruction 
     Bperp.out is not needed for the current sbas.m code and it can be added into the model easily.

3. sbas.m - Linear + Offset model (Solve a very large matrix at once)
   It loads two .mat files dat_looks and tsx_info from step2
   Output the background motion of 365 days and offset map as *.un file

   (1) Change line 7, the time when the jump (the event) occurs
   (2) Change line 18,19, the range and azimuth index of the reference pixel
   (3) Change line 46, the spacial smoothness damping parameter
       alpha = 0 -> invert each pixel independently
